# Purpose of this repository

I've decided to create this repository after few failed job interviews where main problem with me was "lack of commercial experience in web tests / test automation", hoping that after publishing few automated tests it won't be an issue anymore or at least i'll be given an chance to validate my skills in interview exercise.

# How to set it up

You will need node.js on your PC as well as at least Chrome browser installed

1. Download repo
2. Open up command line in folder mentioned earlier
3. run npm install

Now you're good to go - run tests with **npm run test**

# Ending words

I'm planning to create more tests in future.
Providing any feedback about my code is much appreciated.
